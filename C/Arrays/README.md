<br>
<h6>In this C/Arrays folder there are answers of GFG problems of Section Arrays . It may not be necessary that all answers will work in GFG testcases because as this folder is specifically for C language and sometimes there is not option for C.

<p>If you don't find the question that you are looking for then see those relevant files in other datastructures sub-folders in this folders such as Stacks, Trees etc. , as maybe their implementation requires or done in that specific datastruce.
